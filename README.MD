# WARNING
ALL DEVELOPMENT PAUSED. INSTEAD, DEVELOPMENT IS CONTINUING IN C++ REWRITE <a href="https://github.com/j4cegh/PhoenixLang">HERE!</a>
Why? - Because of big file sizes and hard packaging when using Java. I hope you understand.

# SillyLang 
SillyLang is a programming language designed for beginner programmers, but it can be used outside of that case too.

Silly itself uses Java, though all of the coding you are going to be doing is in the simple, HTML-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML!</a>.

Currently Silly is being developed, so please use the newest version.

# Hello World
Currently, hello world is as easy as 1, 2, 3!
This is how you can make a hello world application in Silly:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!--This declares the program. It encapsulates everything inside it.-->
<Program>
    <!--This is the main method. Here begins your application.-->
    <Main>
        <OutputConsole text="Hello, World!" />
    </Main>
</Program>
```
Cool, huh?

# Installation
Will be made possible soon!
